repository for ENVS 193DS take-home final

This repository includes the code and rendered html document for the responses to the take home final of ENVS 193DS. In this assignment, I used two data sets. The first being the Kangaroo Rat Seed Bank data set collected by Terri Koontz and Heather Simpson for their work "Effects of Kangaroo Rat Mounds on Seed Banks of Grass and Shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (2001)." This data set is from the EDI portal and more information about it can be found [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sev.208.102459).I used this data set to analyze how total seed number differs between kangaroo rat mound locations.  
The second data set was the Seed Counts & Weights data set collected by Micaela Seaver for their work "Individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts and pollinator visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge, 2019 - 2021." Like the first data set, this data set is also from the EDI portal. More information can be found [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-nwt.297.1). This data set was used to determine how seed count varies with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences. It was also used to determine whether there is a simpler model that explains seed count.
