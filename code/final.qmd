# Problem 1

## Introduction

Disturbance is a major factor determining the plant community structure of ecological systems. Kangaroo rat (*Dipodomys spectabilis*) mounds are small-scale disturbances that support unique plant communities compared to surrounding habitats. These disturbances can affect the seed bank, an overlooked part of plant communities and an important trait of some plant species that allows for their persistence in unpredictable environments (Koontz & Simpson, 2013). Many might care about these seed bank disturbances because *D. spectabilis* manages the structure of microbial communities (Herrera et al., 2001). These microbes have the ability to recycle the primary elements that make up all living systems, especially carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, three elements that are vital to not only plant communities, but also to animals and humans (Gupta et al., 2016). It could be useful to find how total seed number differs between kangaroo rat mound locations because it could demonstrate a relationship that tells us more about how a plant community is doing in a certain rat mound location as well as whether it is doing better or worse than other plant communities in other rat mound locations. The question I am trying to answer is: How does total seed number differ between kangaroo rat mound locations? The null hypothesis is that total seed number doesn't differ between kangaroo rat mound locations. The alternative hypothesis states the opposite, that total seed number does differ between kangaroo rat mound locations.

# Problem 2

## Introduction

Climate-change induced alterations in environmental conditions in the alpine tundra has led to "shrubification," the expansion of woody shrubs. Shrubification is thought to change microclimatic conditions that could lead to changes in plant community composition, including seed count and weight (Seaver, 2022). Both of these factors, especially seed weight, are significant because seed weight is generally assumed to be an ecologically important life history trait in plants because it influences both dispersal ability and seedling establishment (Gross & Kromer, 1986). Additionally, seed count can be a way to determine fitness and reproductive success (Zimmerman, 1980). It could be useful to find how certain characteristics vary seed count because they could impact reproductive success in plant communities. If certain factors make reproductive success decline, it could bring harm to impacted plant communities especially those containing endangered species. The questions I am trying to answer are how seed count varies with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences as well as what is the simplest model that explains seed count. The hypothesis being tested is that seed count does not vary with plot type.
